# Web Based Application Project

**Food. io** 

Objective: Construct a web application using dynamic web technologies that solves a real-world business problem


Overview: Collaborated with team members to create a food review web based application (similar to Yelp) that allowed users to create an account, search for restaurants, view menu items, follow and 'like' restaurants, and read/leave reviews for each. Restaurants could also pay a fee for better placement on the application.
